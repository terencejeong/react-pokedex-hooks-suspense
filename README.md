# Pokedex

A pokedex of the original 150 pokemon made using React 16.7 utilizing React Hooks, suspense and the unstable react-cache.

Super fun to see how Suspense and react-cache works to fetch data, please note that this is just a playaround.

Also great to use hooks and no class components!

## To Do
Create a proper loader, also potentially a character profile page.

To run locally please clone the repo, yarn install then yarn start.
